Shared library for amazon.cloud code generator and vmware_rest_code_generator
This repository is a collection of well tested python libraries will be used by the [amazon.cloud clode generator](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon_cloud_code_generator/tree/main/amazon_cloud_code_generator) and [vmware code generator](https://github.com/ansible-collections/vmware_rest_code_generator). In the future this repository will become the home of the merged code generator. 
 
The final goal is to move these libraries to the ansible.content_builder repository amd this repository will be archived.
